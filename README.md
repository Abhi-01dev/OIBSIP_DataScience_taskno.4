Title:Email spam Detection with Machine Learning

📌 Objective

To build a Machine Learning model that automatically classifies emails/messages as Spam or Ham (Not Spam) using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.

📊 Dataset

The dataset contains labeled email/text messages:

Message/Text content

Label: Spam or Ham

This helps train the model to detect unwanted or promotional messages.

🛠 Tools Used

Python, Jupyter Notebook, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, NLP (TF-IDF/Count Vectorizer)

🔄 Steps Performed

Loaded the dataset

Cleaned text data (removed punctuation, stopwords, lowercase conversion)

Performed text preprocessing and tokenization

Converted text into numerical features using TF-IDF/Count Vectorizer

Split data into training and testing sets

Applied classification algorithms (Naive Bayes / Logistic Regression)

Evaluated model using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report

✅ Outcome

Successfully classified spam and ham messages with high accuracy

Naive Bayes performed well for text classification

Learned practical implementation of NLP and ML for real-world applications
